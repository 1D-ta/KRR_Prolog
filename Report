# Medical Diagnosis Expert System – Documentation and Results

---

## 🩺 Problem Statement

This project implements a **rule-based medical diagnosis expert system** using Prolog. The aim is to replicate the reasoning of a basic clinical consultation by evaluating user-reported symptoms and estimating the likelihood of various common diseases.

## 🧠 What We Are Doing – System Workflow and Logic

This system uses a **rule-based inference algorithm**, specifically **forward chaining**, to derive diagnoses based on user input. It operates through the following structured pipeline:

---

### 1. 👤 User Interaction and Symptom Collection

The system initiates with the `start.` query.

- **Session Reset**:  
  `clear_data/0` clears old knowledge using dynamic facts (`retractall(known(_, _))`).
  
- **Diagnosis Initiation**:  
  `diagnose/0` calls the necessary components to collect input and generate results.

#### 🔍 Symptom Query Process

Implemented via the predicate `ask_symptom/2`, each symptom is queried as follows:

```prolog
Do you have <symptom>? (yes./no./why./help.)
