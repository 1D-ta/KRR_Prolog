## How to Use This Version:

1. Copy the code above into a SWISH notebook
2. Type `start.` and press Run
3. Answer the questions with:
   - `yes.` if you have the symptom
   - `no.` if you don't have the symptom
   - `why.` to ask why the system needs this information
   - `help.` to see instructions again

## System Behavior:

This version will:
1. Ask about relevant symptoms
2. Calculate a likelihood score for each possible diagnosis
3. Present all possible diagnoses sorted by likelihood percentage
4. Provide specific recommendations if there's a clear diagnosis (>70% likelihood)
5. Advise seeking professional medical advice if symptoms are inconclusive

The approach is now more informative and accurate since it recognizes that symptoms can overlap between multiple conditions and provides you with proportional likelihoods rather than just a single diagnosis.
